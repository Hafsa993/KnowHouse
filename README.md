### Home Page
The Home Page features a dynamic leaderboard at the top, showcasing the top three users by points. Below, users see their open ToDos—tasks assigned to them but not yet accepted.
Clicking a ToDo reveals detailed information, including deadline, reward, category, and description.
Users can accept or decline tasks, with confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental actions. Declining requires a reason.
Upon accepting a task, users receive a notification confirming the task has moved to their "My ToDos" list.

### My Todos
The My ToDos page displays tasks you have accepted but not yet completed, as well as those completed in the last 30 days.
Completing a ToDo triggers a small celebratory animation for positive feedback.

### House ToDos
The House ToDos page lists all tasks in the household—assigned, unassigned, or assigned to others.

- ToDo is taken: Already accepted by a user.
- Assigned to you: Assigned but not yet accepted by you.
- Take on ToDo: Unassigned tasks, open for anyone to claim.
- Users can also take over tasks from other members if they haven't been accepted yet.
  
 ToDos are clickable throughout the app for detailed views.
Adding a ToDo requires specifying category, assignee (or leave unassigned), title, reward, due date, difficulty, and description.
Users with matching category preferences are highlighted for quick assignment.
